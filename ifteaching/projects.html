                    <h4>High School</h4>
                    <p>I was part of a very good local Initiative Project for a group of 18 young people aged 16 to 18 newcomers in France from various places in the world (Asia, Africa, Eastern Europe, Islands). The young people were, for the most part, lost in their new environment and extremely shy. They didn't know how to speak in public. I created a course and workshops with computers and the internet. I also organized tasks to be performed outside: They worked like a team. The results were that the confidence of these amazing young people has increased as well as their ability to communicate and work alone and in a team. The same applies to their autonomy. Around 75% obtained their practical internships through personal research. The result was superior to all other groups followed by the same association. All the young people who chose to stay in France (i.e. 16 out of 18) received a positive orientation which corresponded to their abilities for the next school year.</p>

                    <h4>Individual</h4>
                    <p>I followed with great pleasure a teenage girl during 2 years of middle school with a big lack of understanding in mathematics. As a result, she lost self-confidence and the desire to work in general. I gave her lessons focusing on analysis and algebra in view of her desire for school orientation. I created and developed a visual working method and worked from the simplest to the most complex. I also accompanied her in her professional project through her school project. The results were that her grades improved to excellence in some areas. She regained her confidence. She worked harder and progressed in other subjects. She realized her wish for school orientation: she successfully obtained her BEP in sales and then continued with a professional baccalaureate where she also obtained good results, and, finally, she went on to college.</p>
